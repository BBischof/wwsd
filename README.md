# Geospatial Geometries
This repository contains the data files we will work with in the Working With Spatial Data workshop.

We will explore three basic data types with these files:  
* Polygons - Administrative boundaries (e.g. countries, states and counties)
* Points - Cities
* Lines - Roads, Routes and Rivers
